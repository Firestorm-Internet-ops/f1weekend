One of the most dramatic stretches of coastline on the planet sits just 90 minutes from Melbourne's CBD. The Great Ocean Road hugs the cliffs of Victoria's southwest coast for 243 kilometres, delivering sea stacks, ancient rainforest, wild koalas, and viewpoints that stop you mid-sentence. At its centrepiece stand the Twelve Apostles — towering limestone pillars rising from the Southern Ocean with a force that no photo fully prepares you for.

If you're flying into Melbourne for the 2026 Australian Grand Prix, this day trip belongs on your itinerary. You'll see a side of Australia that has nothing to do with Formula 1 and everything to do with why people travel here in the first place. The tour departs from your Melbourne city hotel, handles every detail, and has you back in the CBD by evening — leaving the race weekend entirely intact.

This article covers everything you need to know before booking your Great Ocean Road tour: what you'll see, exactly when to go during F1 race week, what's included, and what previous guests say about the experience.


## What You'll See on the Great Ocean Road

The tour covers a substantial arc of Victoria's southwest coast. Here are the standout stops.

### The Twelve Apostles

The limestone stacks of the Twelve Apostles are the reason most people make this drive. Formed over millions of years as the Southern Ocean carved and collapsed the soft limestone cliffs, the stacks rise up to 45 metres from the surf. You'll walk to the clifftop boardwalk and look down at them from two angles — the scale only becomes real when you're standing there. Your guide provides geological context and, on a clear morning, the light hitting the stacks from the east is extraordinary.

### Loch Ard Gorge

A few kilometres from the Apostles, Loch Ard Gorge is the site of the 1878 shipwreck of the iron clipper _Loch Ard_. The gorge is a narrow inlet of turquoise water framed by towering sandstone cliffs. It's one of the most dramatic small-scale coastal features on the road — quieter than the Apostles platform and worth every minute you spend there.

### Great Otway National Park Rainforest

Before you reach the coast's limestone drama, the tour takes you through the cool temperate rainforest of Great Otway National Park. You'll walk beneath a canopy of myrtle beech and tree ferns on a guided rainforest walk. The contrast with the open ocean cliffs an hour later is genuinely striking — this isn't just a coastal drive.

### Wild Koala Spotting

The Great Otway region has one of the highest densities of wild koalas in Victoria. Your guide knows the trees where they rest — the spotting success rate on this tour is high enough that it features prominently across the reviews. Multiple guests mention seeing koalas, kangaroos, and other wildlife as an unexpected highlight. You don't need to visit a sanctuary; the wildlife comes with the drive.

### Apollo Bay and Memorial Arch

The tour includes a stop at Apollo Bay, a fishing village on the edge of a sheltered bay, and a photo stop at the Memorial Arch — the symbolic gateway to the Great Ocean Road, built by returned soldiers after World War I. Both stops add depth to a day that could otherwise rush past its most human details.

> **Q: What do you see on the Great Ocean Road day trip from Melbourne?**
> The Great Ocean Road day trip from Melbourne covers the Twelve Apostles limestone sea stacks, Loch Ard Gorge, a guided rainforest walk in Great Otway National Park, wild koala spotting, Apollo Bay, and the Memorial Arch, across a full day of approximately 12 hours.


## The Critical F1 Timing Guide

This is the section that makes or breaks your race week schedule. Read it carefully.

The Great Ocean Road day trip runs for 12 hours. That is a full-day commitment — not a morning activity, not a gap filler between sessions. During the 2026 Australian Grand Prix race week (March 5–8), there is exactly one day where this tour fits without conflict.

**Thursday, March 5 is your day.** Thursday is the official media and fan arrival day for the Australian GP — there are no on-track sessions at Albert Park. The circuit is open for fan walks and driver appearances, but nothing that locks you to a schedule. You can board the minibus from your Melbourne hotel in the morning, spend the day on the coast, and be back in the CBD for dinner with your race week entirely intact.

**Friday through Sunday do not work.** Practice sessions run on Friday, qualifying on Saturday, and the race itself is on Sunday. The tour departs early and returns in the evening, which means it conflicts directly with every significant session block across those three days. Trying to fit a 12-hour day trip around Friday practice or Saturday qualifying is not a realistic option.

If you're arriving in Melbourne on Wednesday, March 4 — the day before the official race week begins — that is another viable option. Wednesday has no circuit obligations and the roads toward the Great Ocean Road are measurably quieter than they will be Thursday when GP visitors are also on the move.

The practical consequence: this tour sells out during race week. F1 visitors and general Melbourne tourists are both competing for the same limited seats (maximum 24 per group). If you want Thursday, March 5, book it as soon as your flights are confirmed. Waiting until you arrive in Melbourne carries real risk of missing out.

> **Q: Can you do the Great Ocean Road day trip during F1 race week in Melbourne?**
> Yes — the Great Ocean Road day trip fits cleanly on Thursday of F1 race week (March 5, 2026), which has no on-track sessions at Albert Park Circuit. Friday, Saturday, and Sunday are not compatible with this 12-hour tour because they conflict with practice, qualifying, and the race.

> **Q: How much does the Great Ocean Road day trip from Melbourne cost?**
> The Great Ocean Road and 12 Apostles day trip from Melbourne costs A$115 per person and includes hotel pick-up and drop-off, National Park entry fees, a guided rainforest walk, and multilingual audio commentary in 16 languages. Food and drinks are not included.


## What to Bring

March on the Great Ocean Road is early autumn in Victoria. Temperatures along the coast can be 5–8°C cooler than Melbourne city and the Southern Ocean wind is persistent. Even on a warm Melbourne morning, bring a layer you can add when you reach the clifftops.

Pack: a windproof jacket, comfortable walking shoes with grip (the rainforest paths and cliff boardwalks involve uneven terrain), sunscreen (the open clifftop sections get full sun), a water bottle, and food for the day. There are no meal stops included in the tour — some guests bring a packed lunch, others buy food at Apollo Bay.

If March rain arrives, the tour runs regardless. The limestone stacks and gorge read differently in overcast light and the rainforest is better in the wet.


## What Guests Say

The tour carries a 4.7 rating from 4,523 reviews on GetYourGuide — one of the highest review counts for any Melbourne day tour on the platform. The pattern across reviews is consistent: the guide is the difference-maker.

Stefanie from Germany wrote: "Unser Guide Tim war super. Trotz viel Regen gegen Ende der Tour war es ein sehr gelungener Tag." Louise from the UK put it plainly: "This was more than just a trip along Great Ocean Road — so much more to see and do. Our tour guide, Sherif was exceptional. Nothing was too much trouble for him." Victoria (Australia) called out the breadth of the day: "We stopped at nice places, saw koalas, kangaroos and other wildlife, had a lovely walk in the rainforest and of course Great Ocean Road and the gem — 12 Apostles."

Alan from the UK noted that his guide took the group to "bonus places" for koala and kangaroo spotting beyond the standard itinerary. An Austrian guest summed it up: "Alles perfekt organisiert, Budgie unser Guide lebt seinen Beruf" — roughly translated: "perfectly organised, our guide lives his work."


## Is the Great Ocean Road Day Trip Worth It?

For an F1 visitor with one free day before race weekend, this is the most immersive use of that day within reach of Melbourne. You'll see a world-class coastal road, a natural wonder that appears on lists of the planet's most dramatic coastlines, ancient temperate rainforest, and wild Australian animals in their actual habitat — all without hiring a car, navigating unfamiliar coastal roads, or figuring out which of 50 possible stops are actually worth your time.

The A$115 price includes hotel transfer, park fees, and a full-day guide. The 4.7 rating across more than 4,500 reviews is a meaningful signal — at that volume, the score reflects consistent execution across hundreds of different guides, weather conditions, and group compositions.

> **Q: Is the Great Ocean Road day trip from Melbourne worth it for F1 visitors?**
> The Great Ocean Road and 12 Apostles day trip is the strongest full-day option for F1 visitors with Thursday free before race week at Albert Park. At A$115, it includes hotel pickup, park fees, and expert guiding across one of the world's most renowned coastal drives — and it fits cleanly within the Australian GP schedule when booked for Thursday, March 5.
