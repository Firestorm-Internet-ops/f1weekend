Category: Day Trip / Wildlife

Every evening at dusk, hundreds of little penguins — the world's smallest penguin species — emerge from the Southern Ocean and waddle up the beach to their burrows at Phillip Island. It is one of Australia's most iconic wildlife spectacles, and it happens year-round, rain or shine, 142 km south-east of Melbourne. If you are in town for the 2026 Australian Grand Prix, Thursday March 5 is your one clear window to see it. This full-day guided tour departs in the afternoon, stops at the Koala Conservation Centre and Churchill Island Heritage Farm, and puts you on the beach at Summerlands just as the sun drops below the horizon.

The tour runs 8 hours and costs A$135 per person. It has collected 3,876 reviews on GetYourGuide with an overall rating of 4.6 out of 5 — one of the highest-rated Melbourne day trips on the platform. Pickup is from the corner of Market and Flinders Streets, next to the Immigration Museum, 400 Flinders Street, in the heart of the CBD.


## What You Will Experience

### The Penguin Parade at Summerlands Beach

The parade is the centrepiece of the day. As darkness falls over Summerlands Beach, the first penguins break the surface and begin their march up the sand. They come in waves — sometimes a handful at a time, sometimes fifty or more — waddling in that distinctive upright shuffle that makes them look simultaneously determined and completely unbothered by the crowd watching from the stands and boardwalks. Your guide will position you before the light fades so you catch the full arrival.

The penguins are little penguins (_Eudyptula minor_), standing around 33 cm tall and weighing roughly 1 kg. They spend their days at sea feeding and return to shore each evening to their burrow mates. Phillip Island's colony is one of the largest in the world. The parade viewing area is managed by Phillip Island Nature Parks, and the standard viewing included in this tour gives you grandstand and boardwalk access on the beach itself.

### Koala Conservation Centre

The afternoon begins at the Koala Conservation Centre, where raised boardwalks put you at eye level with koalas resting in the treetops. Koalas sleep up to 22 hours a day, so you are not watching them do very much — but the proximity is remarkable. Your guide explains their diet, their biology, and the conservation challenges facing the species. It is a calm, unhurried stop before the main event.

### Churchill Island Heritage Farm

Churchill Island is a small working farm connected to Phillip Island by a narrow bridge, with a history dating to 1801 — the site of the first European crops planted in Victoria. The heritage farm demonstrates traditional farming practices and gives you a feel for early colonial Victoria. It is a good stretch-your-legs stop between the drive from Melbourne and the evening at the beach.

> **Q: What does the Phillip Island Penguin Parade tour include?**
> The tour includes pickup from central Melbourne (corner of Market and Flinders Streets), an audio guide in 16 languages, an experienced guide, air-conditioned transport with upgraded seats, standard viewing at the Penguin Parade, and complimentary onboard Wi-Fi. Food is not included — bring your own or plan a stop on the island.


## The F1 Timing Guide — Thursday Is the Only Day That Works

This is not a tour you can slot around a session gap. The 8-hour departure window means you need a full, free day. Here is how the race weekend maps out:

**Thursday, March 5** — This is your day. No sessions at Albert Park. The city is buzzing with pre-race energy but the track is quiet. An afternoon departure from Flinders Street means you are back in Melbourne late in the evening with nothing to miss. This is the day this tour was made for during GP week.

**Friday, March 6** — Practice sessions run during the day. A full-day departure conflicts directly with track action. Not recommended.

**Saturday, March 7** — Qualifying day. Same problem. You would miss the session that defines the grid.

**Sunday, March 8** — Race day. Non-negotiable.

Book Thursday. Book it early. Melbourne Grand Prix week drives significant demand for Phillip Island tours — guides confirmed in multiple reviews that crowd levels at the parade can be high during peak tourist periods, and March is firmly peak season.

> **Q: Can you fit the Phillip Island Penguin Parade tour around the Australian Grand Prix schedule?**
> The Phillip Island Penguin Parade tour is an 8-hour commitment and only fits on Thursday March 5, which is the one track-free day of the 2026 Australian Grand Prix weekend. Friday through Sunday all have sessions that conflict with a full-day departure.


## Practical Information

### Pickup Location

Pickup is from the corner of Market and Flinders Streets, next to the Immigration Museum, at 400 Flinders Street, Melbourne CBD. This is a straightforward walk or tram ride from most central hotels. The meeting point sits within the Free Tram Zone, so if you are staying anywhere in the CBD you can reach it without paying for public transport.

### What to Wear

March is early autumn in Melbourne. Days are warm, but Phillip Island in the evening is coastal and exposed, and temperatures after sunset drop with sea wind. Pack a jacket or fleece regardless of how warm the afternoon felt in the city. Comfortable walking shoes are essential for the boardwalk and farm sections.

### Food and Drink

Food is not included in the A$135 price. There is time on the island for a dinner stop. Bring snacks for the coach if you are coming straight from a lunchtime activity in the city.

### Photography at the Penguin Parade

Flash photography and phone torches are strictly prohibited at the Penguin Parade. The light disorients the penguins and disrupts the parade. This is enforced firmly by Phillip Island Nature Parks wardens on the beach.

> **Q: Can you take photos at the Phillip Island Penguin Parade?**
> Photography is not permitted at the Phillip Island Penguin Parade viewing area. Flash photography and phone torches disorient the penguins and are strictly prohibited by Phillip Island Nature Parks. Cameras must be stowed before you reach the beach.


## Is the Penguin Parade Tour Worth It?

For a Thursday in Melbourne during GP week, yes — this is the day trip that earns the most post-race-week conversation. Every other major Melbourne experience can be done in two to three hours and slotted around a session gap. The Penguin Parade cannot. It requires your whole Thursday, and it delivers something that has nothing to do with motorsport and everything to do with why Australia is extraordinary.

The 4.6 rating across 3,876 reviews is grounded in genuine enthusiasm. Multiple reviews call out guides by name — Mike, Sherif, Michael — which tells you something about the quality of the operation. At A$135 for a full day including transport, guide, and parade entry, the tour represents strong value against the cost of renting a car and driving independently.

> **Q: Is the Phillip Island Penguin Parade tour worth the cost during F1 race week?**
> The Phillip Island Penguin Parade tour at A$135 is worth booking during F1 race week because Thursday is a rare free day in the race schedule, the parade is a once-in-a-trip wildlife experience, and the guided format eliminates the stress of a 4-hour self-drive round trip. With 3,876 reviews and a 4.6 rating, it is one of Melbourne's most trusted day trips.
