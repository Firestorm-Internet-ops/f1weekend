There is a reason the hot air balloon over Melbourne at sunrise has a near-perfect rating after 1,245 reviews: this is not a generic scenic flight. Melbourne is one of the only major cities in the world where you can legally fly a hot air balloon over the CBD — and at dawn, with the skyline turning gold and the Yarra River catching the first light below you, that fact becomes viscerally real.

From the moment the balloon inflates in the pre-dawn dark to the sparkling wine toast on landing, the full experience runs four hours. One of those hours is spent in the air. The rest is ground theatre — watching the envelope fill, helping with inflation, following the balloon by road, and toasting a safe landing. The price is A$379 per person, currently discounted from A$595. If you are in Melbourne for the 2026 Australian Grand Prix, this is the experience that will outlast the race itself in your memory.


## What Makes This Flight Unique

Most balloon operations take you over farmland or wine country — beautiful, but unremarkable as a city experience. Melbourne's airspace regulations, combined with the layout of the CBD, Fitzroy Gardens, and Albert Park, create a rare corridor where a certified operator can float you directly over an urban skyline.

On a clear morning you will see the glittering towers of the CBD to your west, the suburban sprawl reaching east toward the Dandenong Ranges, and the Yarra River threading through parkland below. On a still morning the only sound is the occasional burst of the burner. At altitude, the city looks both immense and oddly intimate — you can pick out the MCG, the Arts Precinct, and the green rectangle of Albert Park itself, the very circuit you have come to Melbourne to watch.

That 360-degree perspective is not a marketing line. The basket rotates slowly as the balloon drifts, and your pilot — who provides running in-flight commentary — points out landmarks as they appear. GoPro photos are captured throughout and included in your package.

> **Q: Is Melbourne really one of the only cities in the world where you can balloon over the CBD?**
> Melbourne's combination of open parkland corridors and permissive low-altitude airspace over the inner suburbs makes it one of a very small number of major cities globally where a licensed operator can legally conduct hot air balloon flights directly over the CBD.


## What the Flight Includes

The A$379 price covers:

- Approximate 1-hour hot air balloon flight at sunrise with in-flight commentary
- Active involvement in balloon inflation and deflation
- Digital flight certificate
- GoPro in-flight photos
- Luxe balloon magnet
- Launch and landing government fees

**Not included:** hotel pickup (you travel to the meeting point independently), discounted parking at the Pullman on the Park Hotel ($10 flat fee until 11:00 AM), and buffet breakfast at the Pullman — unless you book a ticket option that includes it. The base ticket at A$379 does not include breakfast.


## How to Fit This Into Your F1 Race Week

The balloon operates on Thursday and Sunday only. In 2026, those days align perfectly with the Australian Grand Prix schedule.

**Thursday, March 5 — The Best Day to Go**

Thursday is the opening day of race week with no on-track sessions at Albert Park. The balloon departs at dawn. Plan to be at the Pullman on the Park Hotel by around 4:30 AM. By 9:00–10:00 AM you will be back on the ground, certificate in hand, with the entire day still ahead of you. Thursday is the single best day to do this experience during Grand Prix week.

**Sunday, March 8 — Race Morning**

The 2026 Australian Grand Prix race starts at 15:00 AEDT. A Sunday dawn balloon flight means you are airborne at roughly 5:30–6:00 AM and back on solid ground well before 10:00 AM. You have five hours to make your way to Albert Park, find your seat, and absorb the pre-race atmosphere. Starting race day floating 300 metres above Melbourne's skyline is an experience very few people on the planet will have had by the time the lights go out.

> **Q: Does the hot air balloon over Melbourne fit around F1 race week sessions in 2026?**
> The hot air balloon over Melbourne operates on Thursdays and Sundays. During the 2026 Australian Grand Prix (March 5–8), Thursday March 5 is an open day for most fans, and Sunday March 8 sees the race start at 15:00 AEDT — making both mornings ideal for the 4-hour sunrise experience, with plenty of time remaining before any circuit commitments.


## Practical Information: What to Expect on the Day

**Meeting point:** Pullman on the Park Hotel, 192 Wellington Parade, East Melbourne — approximately 4.5 km from Albert Park Circuit (around 16 minutes by car). There is no hotel pickup — you travel to the meeting point independently.

**Arrival time:** Plan to arrive at approximately 4:30 AM. Set two alarms.

**What to wear:** Melbourne in early March is early autumn. Dawn temperatures hover between 12°C and 18°C, but at altitude wind chill is sharper. Wear layered, non-loose clothing — scarves and flapping fabric are not suitable near balloon equipment. Closed-toe shoes are required. A light jacket you can tie around your waist once the sun is fully up is the right call.

**Weather:** Hot air balloons do not fly in strong winds or rain. If your flight is cancelled due to weather, the operator will contact you to reschedule. Book the Thursday March 5 flight rather than Sunday if you want a reschedule window before you leave Melbourne.

> **Q: What happens if the hot air balloon flight over Melbourne is cancelled due to weather?**
> If the hot air balloon flight over Melbourne is cancelled due to weather, the operator will contact you directly to arrange a rebooking. During F1 race week, booking the Thursday flight (March 5) rather than Sunday gives you the greatest chance of a reschedule window before you depart the city.


## Is It Worth A$379?

At A$379, discounted from A$595, this is a premium experience — and it earns that price point. The 4.8 rating across 1,245 verified reviews is one of the strongest for any Melbourne activity on GetYourGuide. The included GoPro in-flight photos alone replace the need for a separate photographer.

The reviews tell a consistent story. Emma from Australia rated it five stars: "I had an incredible time flying over Melbourne — spectacular views of a beautiful city." A traveller from the UK wrote: "Awesome even though we need to wake up at 04:30. The view up there in the air is amazing. After the 3 hours journey, the champagne breakfast is wonderful." An anonymous traveller was direct: "Highly recommend this experience. Being able to fly over the city is a unique experience you won't get anywhere else, due to air space rules. Expensive but well worth saving up."

If you are comparing this against other Melbourne experiences: there are dozens of rooftop bars, food tours, and gallery visits available any day of the week. There is exactly one way to look down at the Melbourne skyline from the air at dawn, and it runs Thursday and Sunday only.
